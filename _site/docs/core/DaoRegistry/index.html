<h2>DaoRegistry description and scope</h2>
<p>The DAO Registry is the identity of the DAO. This is the contract address that is every adapter usually interacts with.</p>
<p>The scope of the registry is to manage the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The adapter registry - which adapter is being used by this DAO and which access it has to the DAO state.</li>
<li>The extension registry - which extension is part of the DAO and the adapter's access to it.</li>
<li>Members registry - whether members exist, their delegate key and their access flags.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each non-constant function in the DAO has an access control modifier linked to it, to make sure the caller has the right to call it.</p>
<p>The DaoRegistry.sol contract tracks the state of the DAO for 1) Adapter and Extension access, 2) State of Proposals, 3) Membership status. For an Adapter to be used it must be registered to DaoRegistry.sol.</p>
<h2>Enums</h2>
<h3>DAO State</h3>
<p><code>enum DaoState {CREATION, READY}</code> CREATION = the DAO has been deployed via <code>initializeDao</code>, but is not ready to be used. READY = the function <code>finalizeDao</code> has been called and is now ready to be used. Once the DaoState = <code>READY</code> then the only way to add additional Adapters is to via the proposal process.</p>
<h3>Access Flags</h3>
<p><code>enum MemberFlag {EXISTS}</code> = <code>EXISTS</code> is true if a member or a proposal exists.</p>
<p><code>enum ProposalFlag {EXISTS, SPONSORED, PROCESSED}</code> = <code>EXISTS</code> true if a proposal has been been submitted. <code>SPONSORED</code> is true if a Submitted proposal has been Sponsored by an existing Member.</p>
<p><code>enum AclFlag { REPLACE_ADAPTER, SUBMIT_PROPOSAL, UPDATE_DELEGATE_KEY, SET_CONFIGURATION, ADD_EXTENSION, REMOVE_EXTENSION, NEW_MEMBER }</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>REPLACE_ADAPTER</code> - if true, the caller adapter has access to add, remove, and replace adapters in the DAO, function <code>dao.replaceAdapter</code>.</li>
<li><code>SUBMIT_PROPOSAL</code> - if true, the caller adapter is allowed to submit/create proposals in the DAO, function <code>dao.submitProposal</code>.</li>
<li><code>UPDATE_DELEGATE_KEY</code> - if true, the caller adapter has the access to update the member's delegated key in the DAO, function <code>dao.updateDelegatedKey</code>.</li>
<li><code>SET_CONFIGURATION</code> - if true, the caller adapter is allowed to store custom configurations as key/value in the DAO, function <code>dao.setConfiguration</code>.</li>
<li><code>ADD_EXTENSION</code> - if true, the caller adapter is allowed to add new Extensions to the DAO, function <code>dao.addExtension</code>.</li>
<li><code>REMOVE_EXTENSION</code> - if true, the caller adapter is allowed to remove Extensions from the DAO, function <code>dao.removeExtension</code>.</li>
<li><code>NEW_MEMBER</code> - if true, the caller adapter has access to register new members in the DAO, function <code>dao.potentialNewMember</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Events</h2>
<pre><code>Events for Proposals - The proposal order follows Moloch v2, in 1) a proposal is submitted, 2) then it sponsored by a member, and 3) after a proposal is voted on, it can finally be processed.

`event SubmittedProposal(bytes32 proposalId, uint256 flags);`
`event SponsoredProposal(bytes32 proposalId, uint256 flags, address votingAdapter);`
`event ProcessedProposal(bytes32 proposalId, uint256 flags);`

Events for Adding and Removing Adapters
`event AdapterAdded(bytes32 adapterId,address adapterAddress,uint256 flags);`
`event AdapterRemoved(bytes32 adapterId);`

Events for Members
`event UpdateDelegateKey(address memberAddress, address newDelegateKey);`

Configuration Events
`event ConfigurationUpdated(bytes32 key, uint256 value);`
`event AddressConfigurationUpdated(bytes32 key, address value);`
</code></pre>
<h2>Structs</h2>
<p><code>struct Proposal</code> the structure to track all the proposals in the DAO and their state (EXISTS, SPONSORED, PROCESSED).</p>
<p><code>struct Member</code> the structure to track all the members in the DAO and their state (EXISTS).</p>
<p><code>struct Checkpoint</code> Tribute makes use of the off-chain voting mechanism Snapshot. The <code>Checkpoint</code> struct assists with verifying the optimistic voting and proposal mechanisms at various blocktimes. See, https://github.com/snapshot-labs.</p>
<p><code>struct DelegateCheckpoint</code> A checkpoint for marking number of votes from a given block.</p>
<p><code>struct AdapterEntry</code> When an Adapter is added to <code>DaoRegistry</code> via the function <code>replaceAdapter</code>, a bytes32 <code>id</code> and a uint256 <code>acl</code> are parameters assigned to the Adapter for use in identifying the Adapter.</p>
<p><code>struct ExtensionEntry</code> When an Extension is added to <code>DaoRegistry</code> via <code>addExtenstion</code> a bytes32 <code>id</code> and a uint256 <code>acl</code> are parameters assigned to the Extension for use in identifying the Extension.</p>
<h2>Registry state &amp; Public Variables</h2>
<h3>mapping(address =&gt; Member) public members</h3>
<p>Mapping of all the members. Member struct contains the flags uint.</p>
<h3>address[] private _members</h3>
<p>List of all the member addresses. Useful to iterate through members.</p>
<h3>mapping(address =&gt; address) public memberAddressesByDelegatedKey</h3>
<p>Mapping of the member address by delegate key (think inverted mapping from members by delegate key).</p>
<h3>mapping(address =&gt; mapping(uint32 =&gt; DelegateCheckpoint)) checkpoints</h3>
<p>Delegate key checkpoints. This is useful to know what the delegate key is at a certain point in time.</p>
<h3>mapping(address =&gt; uint32) numCheckpoints</h3>
<p>Checkpoint lengths per member address.</p>
<h3>DaoState public state</h3>
<p>Dao state. This is used to know if the DAO is currently being set up or if it is already running. Useful to configure it.</p>
<h3>mapping(bytes32 =&gt; Proposal) public proposals</h3>
<p>Mapping of all the proposals for the DAO. Each proposal has an adapterAddress (which adapter created it) and flags to define its state.</p>
<h3>mapping(bytes32 =&gt; address) public adapters</h3>
<p>Mapping of all the adapters. bytes32 is the keccak256 of their name and address.</p>
<h3>mapping(address =&gt; AdapterEntry) public inverseAdapters</h3>
<p>Mapping of adapter details. For each address, we can get its id (keccak256(name)) and its acl (access control, which function in the DAO it has access to).</p>
<h3>mapping(bytes32 =&gt; address) public extensions</h3>
<p>Mapping of each extension. Like for adapters, the key here is keccak256(name) (e.g., keccak256(&quot;bank&quot;))</p>
<h3>mapping(address =&gt; ExtensionEntry) public inverseExtensions</h3>
<p>Mapping of extension details. For each extension address, you get its id (keccak256(name)) and a mapping from adapter address =&gt; access control.
Access control for each extension is centralized in the DaoRegistry to avoid each extension implementing its own ACL system.</p>
<h3>mapping(bytes32 =&gt; uint256) public mainConfiguration</h3>
<p>Generic configuration mapping from key (keccak256(name)) to any type that can be encoded in 256 bytes (does not need to be uint, could be bytes32 too).</p>
<h3>mapping(bytes32 =&gt; address) public addressConfiguration</h3>
<p>Since addresses are not encoded in 256 bytes, we need a separate configuration mapping for this type.</p>
<h2>Functions description, assumptions, checks, dependencies, interactions and access control</h2>
<p>Note: the constructor function is non-existent, because this is a Cloneable contract. See, https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167</p>
<h3>function initialize(address creator, address payer) external</h3>
<p>Initializes the DAO by creating the initial members who are 1) the DAO creator passed to the function, 2) the account passed to the function which paid for the transaction to create the DAO, and 3) the DaoFactory calling this function.</p>
<h3>function finalizeDao()</h3>
<p>Mark the DAO as finalized. After that, changes can only be made through adapters.</p>
<h3>function setConfiguration(bytes32 key, uint256 value)</h3>
<p>Set a generic configuration entry for the DAO.
Only adapters with access to this function can do it.</p>
<h3>function setAddressConfiguration(bytes32 key, address value)</h3>
<p>Set an address configuration entry for the DAO.
Only adapters with access to this function can do it.</p>
<h3>function potentialNewMember(address memberAddress)</h3>
<p>This functions checks if the member exists in the DAO. If the member does not exist,
it creates the entry for the new member.
That means creating an entry in the members mapping, setting the delegate key to be the same address as the new member and adding the address to the members list.</p>
<h3>function getConfiguration(bytes32 key) external view returns (uint256)</h3>
<p>Get the generic config entry by passing the keccak256(config name).</p>
