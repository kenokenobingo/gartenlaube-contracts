<h2>Extension description and scope</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc20">ERC20</a> contract safely manages the transfers of tokens that represent the voting power of each member of the DAO.</p>
<p>The extension adds to the DAO the capability of managing the voting power of members and external individuals in the DAO. It does that by tracking the token transfers between DAO members, or even, transfer from members to external accounts. That enhances the DAO features by allowing individuals that are not part of the DAO receive voting rights.</p>
<h2>Extension state</h2>
<h3>DaoRegistry public dao;</h3>
<p>The DAO address that this extension belongs to</p>
<h3>bytes32 public constant ERC20_EXT_TRANSFER_TYPE = keccak256(&quot;erc20ExtTransferType&quot;);</h3>
<p>The custom configuration to set the transfer type, e.g:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: transfers are enabled only between dao members</li>
<li>1: transfers are enabled between dao members and external accounts</li>
<li>2: all transfers are paused</li>
</ul>
<p>It needs to be set via a <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/blob/master/docs/adapters/Configuration.md">Configuration proposal</a>, if the proposal pass, the new configuration gets stored in the DAO. By default, only transfers between members are allowed.</p>
<h3>bool public initialized = false;</h3>
<p>Internally tracks deployment under eip-1167 proxy pattern</p>
<h3>address public tokenAddress;</h3>
<p>The token address managed by the DAO that tracks the internal transfers</p>
<h3>string public tokenName;</h3>
<p>The name of the token managed by the DAO</p>
<h3>string public tokenSymbol;</h3>
<p>The symbol of the token managed by the DAO</p>
<h3>uint8 public tokenDecimals;</h3>
<p>The number of decimals of the token managed by the DAO. The default number of decimals is 0 in <code>utils/DeploymentUtils.js.</code> It is set to 0, because then the number of Units issued by the Bank Extension is tracked on a 1:1 basis with the number of tokens. For example, in the DAO issues 1 Unit to a member, then the display in a wallet such as MetaMask will be equal &quot;1&quot; Token. Otherwise, if the default was to the standard 18 decimals, then it would display in MetaMask as &quot;0.000000000000000001&quot; Token.</p>
<h3>mapping(address =&gt; mapping(address =&gt; uint256)) private _allowances;</h3>
<p>Tracks all the token allowances: owner =&gt; spender =&gt; amount</p>
