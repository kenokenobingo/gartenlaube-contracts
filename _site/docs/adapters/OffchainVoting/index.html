<h2>Adapter description and scope</h2>
<p>This adapter manages offchain voting using a merkle tree to commit to a result that can be challenge during the grace period if necessary.</p>
<p>There are also two fallback solutions implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>fallback voting that falls back to simple onchain voting if something is wrong</li>
<li>admin force fail proposal to mark a proposal as failed by an admin if necessary. This is present until a more formal verfication of the system is done</li>
</ul>
<h3>General concept</h3>
<p>The idea is to use a merkle tree to commit to a computation (calculate the result) and have a way to challenge a result if anyone sees an issue in the computation.</p>
<p>The approach assumes data availability.</p>
<p>Each leaf in the merkle tree is a &quot;step&quot; in computing the vote result. The last leaf is the result (and the leaf submitted).</p>
<p>This works with a modified version of snapshot that uses ERC-712 for hashing / signing proposals and votes</p>
<h2>Adapter configuration</h2>
<h3>VotingPeriod = keccak256(&quot;voting.votingPeriod&quot;)</h3>
<p>How long does a vote occur.</p>
<h3>GracePeriod = keccak256(&quot;voting.gracePeriod&quot;)</h3>
<p>How long does anyeone have to challenge a result if an issue is spotted.</p>
<h3>FallbackThreshold = keccak256(&quot;offchainvoting.fallbackThreshold&quot;)</h3>
<p>What threshold ( in % ) of members need to request a fallback voting for it to kick in.</p>
<h2>Functions description, assumptions, checks, dependencies, interactions and access control</h2>
<h3>function adminFailProposal(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId)</h3>
<p>Admin function (only owner can call it) to fail a proposal. Used as a failsafe if anything goes wrong since the adapter is still new</p>
<h3>function submitVoteResult(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId, bytes32 resultRoot, VoteResultNode memory result) external</h3>
<p>Submits a new vote result for a specific dao / proposalId.
result is the last step that contains the vote result.
resultRoot is the merkle root of the computation merkle tree.</p>
<p>If a result has been already published, it checks whether this one has more steps (index is higher) or if the vote is already finished.</p>
<p>If the voting period is not done yet but the result cannot be changed anymore (50+% have voted either yes or no), the grace period starts right away</p>
<h3>function voteResult(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId) returns (VotingState state)</h3>
<p>Returns the status of a vote session.</p>
<h3>function challengeBadNode(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId, VoteResultNode memory nodeCurrent) external</h3>
<p>Checks and marks a result as bad if a specific node has bad data.
The checks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>bad signature</li>
<li>invalid choice</li>
<li>bad proposalHash</li>
<li>vote timestamp is after the current grace period started</li>
</ul>
<h3>function _isValidChoice(uint256 choice) internal pure returns (bool)</h3>
<p>function defining what a valid choice is</p>
<h3>function challengeBadStep(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId, VoteResultNode memory nodePrevious, VoteResultNode memory nodeCurrent) external</h3>
<p>Checks that the step from a node to another is correct or not
let's define a step function S(state, choice) that creates a new state based on a previous one and a choice
We check that S(previousState, currentChoice) = currentState
If not, we challenge the result</p>
<h3>function requestFallback(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId) external onlyMember(dao)</h3>
<p>If something is wrong with the vote but it is not possible to challenge it, members can request a fallback</p>
<h3>function sponsorChallengeProposal(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId, address sponsoredBy)</h3>
<p>If a result has been challenged, it is needed to vote on the faith of the reporter. Should he continue being a member or should he be banned.</p>
<h3>function processChallengeProposal(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId)</h3>
<p>Process the vote for the faith of a bad reporter</p>
