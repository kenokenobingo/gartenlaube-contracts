<h2>Adapter description and scope</h2>
<p>The Distribute Adapter provides features in which the DAO members can receive funds from the DAO for any given reason. A good example of that is when the members collectively agree to payout dividends to one or all member of the DAO, when that happens they can submit a proposal for voting, and if the proposal pass the amount is distributed equally to the members.</p>
<h2>Adapter workflow</h2>
<p>The token distribution starts when a member submits a proposal to distribute a certain amount of a token for one or all members of the DAO. It is important to mention that the distribution can only happen for 1 member or for all, there is no way to distribute the tokens for a subset of the DAO members.</p>
<p>Once the distribution proposal gets created, it is open for voting, and sponsored by the message sender. The adapter tracks all the distributions that have been executed already by each DAO, and also tracks the current distributions that is in progress - this is done to ensure the distributions are executed sequentially per DAO.</p>
<p>Once the distribution proposal has passed, the other members have to start the actual distribution process (function <code>processProposal</code>). In this process the member indicated in the proposal or each member of the DAO will receive, based on the current number of holding units, a token amount in the internal bank account, so it can be withdraw later on. This process does not changes the number of units of the members, it just uses it to calculate the fair amount to distribute for each member. After that, the distribution proposal gets updated to <code>Completed</code>.</p>
<h2>Adapter configuration</h2>
<p>The member needs to have at least 1 unit to be able to receive funds from a distribution proposal.</p>

<h2>Adapter state</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>DistributionStatus</code>: The distribution status (<code>Not Started</code>, <code>In Progress</code>, <code>Done</code>).</li>
<li><code>Distribution</code>: State of the proposal.
<ul>
<li><code>token</code>: The distribution token in which the members should receive the funds. Must be supported by the DAO.</li>
<li><code>amount</code>: The amount to distribute.</li>
<li><code>status</code>: The distribution status.</li>
<li><code>unitHolderAddr</code>: The member address that should receive the funds, if 0x0, the funds will be distributed to all members of the DAO.</li>
<li><code>currentIndex</code>: Current iteration index to control the cached for-loop.</li>
<li><code>blockNumber</code>: The block number in which the proposal has been created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>distributions</code>: Keeps track of all the distributions executed per DAO.</li>
<li><code>ongoingDistributions</code>: Keeps track of the latest ongoing distribution proposal per DAO to ensure only 1 proposal can be processed at a time.</li>

<h2>Events</h2>
<p>When the distribution process is completed the <code>Distributed</code> event is emitted with the <code>token</code>, <code>amount</code>, and <code>unitHolder</code> parameters. If the <code>unitHolder</code> is <code>0x0</code>, the amount was distributed to <strong>all</strong> members of the DAO, otherwise it was distributed to the unit holder only.</p>
