<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts#adapters">Adapters</a> are well defined, tested and extensible smart contracts that are created with a unique purpose. One Adapter is responsible for performing one or a set of tasks in a given context. With this approach we can develop adapters targeting specific use-cases, and update the DAO configurations to use these new adapters.</p>
<p>When a new adapter is created, one needs to submit a Managing proposal to add the new adapter to the DAO. Once the proposal passes, the new adapter is added and becomes available for use.</p>
<p>Each adapter needs to be configured with the <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts#access-control-layer">Access Flags</a> in order to access the <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts#core-contracts">Core Contracts</a>, and/or <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts##extensions">Extensions</a>. Otherwise the Adapter will not able to interact with the DAO.</p>
<h3>Defining the Interface</h3>
<p>The adapter must implement one or more of the available interfaces at <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/tree/master/contracts/adapters/interfaces">contracts/adapters/interfaces</a>. If none of these interfaces match the use-case of your adapter, feel free to suggest a new interface.</p>
<h3>Pick the right Adapter type</h3>
<p>There are two main types of adapters that serve different purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proposal: writes/reads to/from the DAO state based on a proposal, and the proposal needs to pass, otherwise the DAO state changes are not applied, e.g: <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/blob/master/contracts/adapters/GuildKick.sol">GuildKick.sol</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>

<pre><code class="language-solidity">/**
 * @notice default fallback function to prevent from sending ether to the contract.
 */

  revert(&quot;fallback revert&quot;);
}

/**
 * @notice Explain what the function does in addition to the proposal submission.
 * @dev Describe any required states/checks/parameters that are necessary to execute the function.
 * @param dao The DAO address.
 * @param proposalId The proposal id that is managed by the client.

function submitXProposal(
  DaoRegistry dao,

  type1 param1,
  type2 param2,

  // If the submission needs to be restricted by DAO members/advisors
  // it is a good practice to use the helper function from the IVoting interface.
  // Mainly because if you have an offchain voting Adapter enabled, the sender address may vary.
  IVoting votingContract = IVoting(dao.getAdapterAddress(VOTING));
  address submittedBy =
    votingContract.getSenderAddress(dao, address(this), data, msg.sender);

  dao.submitProposal(proposalId);

  // If you want to sponsor the proposal right away, you need to start the voting process.
  IVoting votingContract = IVoting(dao.getAdapterAddress(VOTING));
  votingContract.startNewVotingForProposal(dao, proposalId, data);

  // Finally sponsor the x proposal.
  // The DAO already checks if the proposal exists and is being sent by a member/advisor.
  dao.sponsorProposal(proposalId, submittedBy);

  // If you do want to start the voting and sponsor the proposal in the same transaction,
  // just include these 2 last calls into a new function that must be triggered in another transaction.

<h3>Identifying the Modifiers</h3>
<p>We have adapters that are accessible only to members and/or advisors of the DAO (e.g: <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/blob/master/docs/adapters/Ragequit.md">Ragequit.sol</a>), and adapters that are open to any individual or organization, e.g: <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/blob/master/docs/adapters/Financing.md">Financing.sol</a>.</p>
<p>While creating the adapter try to identify which sort of users you want to grant access to. Remember that the adapters are the only way we have to alter the DAO state, so be careful with the access modifiers you use. We already have some of them implemented, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/blob/master/docs/guards">docs/guards</a>, and feel free to suggest new ones if needed.</p>
<h3>Map out the proper Access Flags</h3>
<p>Another important point is to map out which sort of permissions your adapter needs in order to write/read data to/from the DAO. If your adapter requires an <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts#extensions">Extension</a>, you will also need to provide the correct <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts#access-control-layer">Access Flags</a> to access that extension. Checkout which permission each flag grants: <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/blob/master/docs/helpers/FlagHelper.md">Flag Helper</a>.</p>
<h3>Set up the DAO custom configurations</h3>
<p>Some adapters might need customized/additional configurations to make decisions on the fly. These configurations can and should be set per DAO. In order to do that you need to identify what sort of parameters that you want to keep customizable and set them up through the <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/blob/master/docs/adapters/Configuration.md">Configuration Adapter</a>.</p>
<h3>Be mindful of the storage costs</h3>
<p>The key advantage of the adapters is to make them very small and suitable to a very specific use-case. With that in mind we try to not use the storage that much. We prefer efficient and cheap adapters that can be easily deployable and maintainable. The less state it maintains and operations it executes, the better.</p>
<h3>Conventions &amp; Implementation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Function names (public)</p>
<ul>
<li>For Adapter that is a Proposal type
<ul>
<li>submitXProposal</li>
<li>processProposal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function names (private)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revert as early as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your adapter should not accept any funds. So it is a good practice to always revert the receive call.</p>
<pre><code class="language-solidity">/**
 * @notice default fallback function to prevent from sending ether to the contract.
 */
receive() external payable {
  revert(&quot;fallback revert&quot;);
}

</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you add the correct <code>require</code> checks</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually the adapter needs to perform some verifications before executing the calls that may change the DAO state. Double check if the DAORegistry functions that your adapter uses already implement some checks, so you do not need to repeat them in the adapter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update the DAOConstants</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are creating an adapter that does not have the <code>keccak256</code> id declared in the <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/blob/master/contracts/core/DaoConstants.sol#L30">DAOConstants</a> make sure you add it there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testing the new Adapter</h3>
<p>In order to verify if the new adapter works properly, one needs to implement the basic test suite, so we can ensure it is actually doing what it was supposed to do.</p>
<p>There are several examples of tests that you can check to start building your own. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/tree/master/test/adapters">tests/adapters</a>.</p>
<p>Another important step in the test phase is to configure the adapter permissions during the DAO creation in the <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/blob/master/utils/DaoFactory.js#L140">DAOFactory.js</a>.</p>
<h3>Adding documentation</h3>
<p>Each adapter must provide its own documentation describing what is the use-case it solves, what are the functions and interactions it contains. There is a template that you can use to create the docs for your new adapter, check out the <a href="https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/blob/master/docs/adapters/Template.md">Template.md</a>.</p>
<h3>Done</h3>
<p>If you have followed all the steps above and created a well tested, documented Adapter, please submit a Pull Request so we can review it and provide additional feedback. Thank you!</p>
