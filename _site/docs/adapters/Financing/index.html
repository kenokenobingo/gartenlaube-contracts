<h2>Adapter description and scope</h2>
<p>Financing is the process in which an applicant, member or a non-member of the DAO, submits a proposal asking for funds. If the proposal passes, the funds are released to the applicant.</p>
<p>The main goal is to allow individuals and/or organizations to request funds to finance their projects, and the members of the DAO have the power to vote and decide which projects should be funded.</p>
<h2>Adapter workflow</h2>
<p>In order to request funds from the DAO, the applicant must submit a proposal in which one must specify the desired amount and the token address to receive the funds.</p>
<p>The applicant address cannot be a reserved address, which means the address is already reserved for the DAO internal usage. Also, the token address must be allowed/supported by the DAO Bank. If these two conditions are not met, the funding proposal is not created.</p>
<h2>Adapter configuration</h2>
<p>Tokens that are provided by the member have to be allowed/supported by the DAO.</p>
<p>The member needs to have enough units and/or loot in order to convert it to funds.</p>
