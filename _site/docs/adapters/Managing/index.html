<h2>Adapter description and scope</h2>
<p>The Managing adapter handles the proposal creation, sponsorship and processing of a new adapter including its initial configuration, and permissions.</p>
<p>An adapter can be added, removed or replaced in the DAO registry. In order to remove an adapter one must pass the address 0x0 with the adapter id that needs to be removed. In order to add a new adapter one most provide the adapter id, address and access flags. The address of the new adapter can not be a reserved address, and the id must be a known id as defined in the <code>DaoConstants.sol</code>. The replace adapter operation removes the adapter from the registry based on the adapter id parameter, and also adds a new adapter using the same id but with a new address.</p>
<h2>Adapter workflow</h2>
<p>Submit a proposal and check:</p>
<ul>
<li>if caller is an active member</li>
<li>if keys and values have equal length</li>
<li>if adapter address is valid</li>
<li>if the access flags don't overflow</li>
<li>if adapter address is not reserved</li>
</ul>
<p>If all the requirements pass, then the proposal is subitted to registry and the adapter stores the proposal data.</p>
<p>To sponsor a proposal, you need to be an active member, and once sponsored the voting process starts.</p>
<p>Once the voting period ends, only a member can process the proposal. The proposal is processed only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the caller is an active member</li>
<li>the has not been processed already</li>
<li>the proposal has been sponsored</li>
<li>the voting has passed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adapter configuration</h2>
<p>DAORegistry Access Flags: <code>SUBMIT_PROPOSAL</code>, <code>REPLACE_ADAPTER</code>.</p>
<h2>Adapter state</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>proposals</code>: All the proposals handled by the adapter per DAO.</li>
<li><code>ProposalDetails</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>adapterId</code>: The id of the adapter to add, remove or replace.</li>
<li><code>adapterAddress</code>: The address of the new adapter contract.</li>
<li><code>keys</code>: The configuration keys for the adapter.</li>
<li><code>values</code>: The values to set for the adapter configuration.</li>
<li><code>flags</code>: The ACL for the new adapter.</li>
</ul>
