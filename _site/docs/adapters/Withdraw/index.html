<h2>Adapter description and scope</h2>
<p>The Withdraw adapter allows a member or an advisor of the DAO to withdraw the available funds in their bank account.</p>
<p>It is considered a Generic adapter because it does not rely on any proposals to perform an action that changes the DAO state.</p>
<h2>Adapter workflow</h2>
<p>The user sends a transaction to withdraw the funds from the internal bank account. If there are no available funds, the transaction is reverted. If the user is using an address that is reserved to the DAO, the transaction is also reverted. And when the user provides a token that is not supported by the bank, the balance is always zero and the transaction gets reverted as well.</p>
<p>If all the parameters are valid, the user should be able to identify the funds transferred to its own account.</p>
<h2>Adapter configuration</h2>
<p>Bank Extension Access Flags: <code>WITHDRAW</code>, <code>SUB_FROM_BALANCE</code>.</p>
<h2>Adapter state</h2>
<p>The adapter does not keep track of any state during the withdraw process.</p>
