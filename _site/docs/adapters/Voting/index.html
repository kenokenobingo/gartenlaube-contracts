<h2>Adapter description and scope</h2>
<p>This adapter manages on chain &quot;simple&quot; voting.</p>
<h2>Adapter state</h2>
<pre><code class="language-solidity">struct Voting {
  uint256 nbYes;
  uint256 nbNo;
  uint256 startingTime;
  uint256 blockNumber;
  mapping(address =&gt; uint256) votes;
}

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>nbYes: how many yes have been casted</li>
<li>nbNo: how many no have been casted</li>
<li>startingTime: starting time of the voting process</li>
<li>mapping of member =&gt; vote to keep track of everybody's vote and know if they have already voted or not</li>
</ul>
<p><code>mapping(address =&gt; mapping(bytes32 =&gt; Voting)) public votes;</code>
mapping for each adapter of proposalId =&gt; voting state where voting state is</p>
<h2>Adapter configuration</h2>
<p>Two configurations are possible for the voting adapter:</p>
<h3>VotingPeriod = keccak256(&quot;voting.votingPeriod&quot;)</h3>
<p>How long after the starting time is the voting valid</p>
<h3>GracePeriod = keccak256(&quot;voting.gracePeriod&quot;)</h3>
<p>How long after the end of the voting period is the result settled</p>
<h2>Functions description, assumptions, checks, dependencies, interactions and access control</h2>
<h3>function startNewVotingForProposal(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId, bytes calldata)</h3>
<p>This is called every time a proposal is being sponsored. This starts the voting process.</p>
<p>We assume here that the adapter uses <code>dao.sponsorProposal()</code> to make sure it is not called multiple times on the same proposal.</p>
<h3>function getSenderAddress(DaoRegistry, address, bytes memory, address sender) returns (address)</h3>
<p>This function allows the voting adapter determine who is signing the message based on the data sent.
In the case of Voting, it's always <code>msg.sender</code>. But for other implementations, signed data could be used to determine it and let a relayer do the call.</p>
<h3>function submitVote(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId, uint256 voteValue)</h3>
<p>Casts a vote. Only a member can submit a vote.</p>
<p>We check that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposal has been sponsored</li>
<li>The proposal has not been processed yet</li>
<li>The vote has started (startingTime &gt; 0)</li>
<li>The vote has not ended yet</li>
<li>The member has not voted yet</li>
<li>The vote is valid (only either yes or no)</li>
</ul>
<h3>function voteResult(DaoRegistry dao, bytes32 proposalId) returns (VotingState state)</h3>
<p>Gets back the vote result for a certain proposal.
If the vote has not started yet, return <code>NOT_STARTED</code>.
If the vote is still on going (after starting time but before startingTime + voting period) return <code>IN_PROGRESS</code>.
If the vote has ended but is still in grace period, return <code>GRACE_PERIOD</code>.
If none of the above and more yes votes than no votes, return <code>PASS</code>.
If more no votes than yes votes, return <code>NOT_PASS</code>.
If yes votes equals no votes, return <code>TIE</code>.</p>
