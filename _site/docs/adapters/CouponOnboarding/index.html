<h2>Adapter description and scope</h2>
<p>The CouponOnboarding adapter provides a way to onboard an initial group of members quickly without requiring multiple proposals.</p>
<p>The DAO creator can produce and sign coupons which allow redemption of a particular number of units by a given address. When the coupon is redeemed
the units are directly issued to the new member.</p>
<h2>Adapter workflow</h2>
<p>Redeem coupon request</p>
<ul>
<li>check that the coupon has not already been redeemed</li>
<li>check that the signed hash matches the hash of the redeem arguments</li>
<li>check that the signer of the coupon matches the configured signer</li>
<li>mint the configured tokens to the new member</li>
<li>mark the coupon redeemed</li>
</ul>
