<h2>Adapter description and scope</h2>
<p>This is a template for the documentation of an Adapter.</p>
<p>Here you can provide a brief description of the adapter and what is the use-case covered by the implementation. It is also good to add the goal of the Adapter and what value it brings to the DAO.</p>
<h2>Adapter workflow</h2>
<p>An overview of the entire process executed by Adapter functions, the main interactions and routines covered/executed.</p>
<h2>Adapter configuration</h2>
<p>Specify which additional configurations are required to make this adapter work. For instance: needs access to the DAO members, needs access to the DAO Bank, relies on Adapter X, Y and Extension Z.</p>
<p>DAORegistry Access Flags: <code>SUBMIT_PROPOSAL</code>, ....</p>
<p>Bank Extension Access Flags: <code>WITHDRAW</code>, <code>INTERNAL_TRANSFER</code>, ....</p>
<h2>Adapter state</h2>
<p>Describe each variable public and private of the adapter and what is the purpose of that variable.</p>
<h2>Dependencies and interactions (internal / external)</h2>
<p>Add the information about all the interactions that are triggered by this DAO, which contracts it depends on, and which functions it calls.</p>
<h2>Functions description and assumptions / checks</h2>
<p>Describe the public and private functions signatures with proper documentation and clearly explain what each function does. Specify what are expected the arguments and pre-conditions to execute the functions. Also, provide what is the expected outcome.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<h3>receive() external payable</h3>
<h3>function submitKickProposal</h3>
<pre><code class="language-solidity">    /**
     * @notice Creates a guild kick proposal, opens it for voting, and sponsors it.
     * @dev A member can not kick himself.
     * @dev Only one kick per DAO can be executed at time.
     * @dev Only members that have units can be kicked out.
     * @dev Proposal ids can not be reused.
     * @param dao The dao address.
     * @param proposalId The guild kick proposal id.
     * @param memberToKick The member address that should be kicked out of the DAO.
     * @param data Additional information related to the kick proposal.

<h2>Events</h2>
<p>List all the events that are emitted by the function in this Adapter implementation.</p>
