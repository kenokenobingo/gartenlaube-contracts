<h2>Adapter description and scope</h2>
<p>Ragequit is the process in which a member of the DAO decides to opt out of the DAO for any given reason.</p>
<p>This implementation of ragequit adapter does not cover the case in which the member is put in jail before updating the internal balance - as it happens in Moloch V2 to disincentivize the behavior in which members vote Yes on proposals that are essentially bad for the future of the DAO, and right after that they quit with their funds.</p>
<p>It also does not check if the member has voted Yes on a proposal that is not processed yet, and does not keep track of the latest proposal that was voted Yes on.</p>
<p>The main goal is to give the members the freedom to choose when it is the best time to withdraw their funds without any additional preconditions, except for the fact that they need to have enough units to be converted to funds. Members do not need to convert all their units/loot at once.</p>
<h2>Adapter workflow</h2>
<p>In order to opt out of the DAO, the member needs to indicate the amount of units and/or loots that the member has decided to burn (to convert back into a token value).</p>
<p>The proportional units and/or loots are burned when the member provides the tokens in which one expects to receive the funds. The funds are deducted from the internal DAO bank balance, and added to the member's internal balance.</p>
<p>If the member provides at least one invalid token, e.g: a token that is not supported/allowed by the DAO, the entire ragequit process is canceled/reverted. By default the adapter expects that the token array is sorted in ascending order. This is done to test for duplicates, and each token needs to be smaller than the next one, otherwise the transaction is reverted.
In addition to that, if the member provides a long list of tokens that may cause issues due to the block size limit, it is expected that the transaction returns a failure, so it can be retried in another run with a fewer tokens.</p>
<p>Once the ragequit process is completed, the funds are deducted from the bank, added to the member's internal balance, and an event called <code>MemberRagequit</code> is emitted.</p>
<h2>Adapter configuration</h2>
<p>Tokens that are provided by the member have to be allowed/supported by the DAO.</p>
<p>The member/advisor needs to have enough units and/or loot in order to convert it to funds.</p>
